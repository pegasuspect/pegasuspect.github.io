            <li>
              <b>Deep learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. 
              I read a book named 
              <a 
                href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35518108-machine-learning">

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reparing & DIY</b>. I've been an "enthusiastic" repairmen since 
              I was a kid, mostly breaking my toys, ðŸ˜Š - but only as an adult 
              am I able to afford the higher-quality tools. 
              I like to fix simple mechanical defects, or circumvent them even 
              if it takes some of my time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Volleyball</b>. I am playing volleyball with a Turkish friend 
              group, join us if you like in New Jersey!
