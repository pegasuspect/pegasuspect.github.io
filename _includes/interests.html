            My personal interests include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Deep learning</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I read a book named <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35518108-machine-learning">Machine Learning: A Visual Starter Course For Beginner's</a>. I am planning to build a bot for advertisements through ML.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Reparing & DIY</b>. I've been an enthusiastic repairmen since I was a kid (mostly breaking my toys lol) - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
              devices. I like to fix simple mechanical parts instead of paying a mechanic a lot of money.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Skating</b>. I like to do extreme sports involving balance and tricks. I like ski and horseback riding too.
